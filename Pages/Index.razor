        <h5>The Make Projects Initiative is aimed to be a collection of <strong>Open Source</strong>
            projects made collaboritavely between programmers as a platform of support. Not only serves
            as a goal, but a dream where any project may be made available with a little brainstorming...
        </h5>    
        <h5>
            Open Source is the key to this project, and it's ideology identifies that anyone may be able to view 
            the source code and customize or add however they see fit. In MKProjects, we will implement a merge request 
            system where the changes are reviewed, and if acceptable will be merged to the master branch.

            The books project is aimed to provide opensource books on various languages with
            varying difficulty pathways. Someone that may be starting would go for a basics book, 
            while a more moderate learner would go into a more book. Minerva is the application part
            of the application, and is aimed to provide an offline experience outside of a web-application. 
            Currently Minerva is developed as a Desktop application using the Electron framework, and I'm working
            to provide on Mobile as well.

        <h4><span class="w3-tag w3-black">Moka Reads</span></h4>
        <p>
            Moka Reads is a more of a blog/newspaper article section of the website where issues talk about various topics
            on programming. Some have talked about my non-aptitude towards using Python, or my aptitude using Rust, it's 
            pretty much a place I can rant about programming on, and if you would like to, contact me!
